# PhoneGapPDF

This is an example phonegap application that will generate a PDF. This isn't a full fledge application but it's something that can be used to build on or just see how phonegap works. I just made this while playing around with the technology.

The biggest thing inside of this is it can generate a PDF based on the code you define.
